Issue usage was very sparse for functional development; in fact, the majority of the issues were questions directed towards me, not development milestones.  Milestones were created that had no Issues associated with them (and remain open in the repo).
Unit test coverage of functions is not comprehensive:

test_Diagnosis() takes a while to run (~ 1 min); unit tests should be nimble so that they can be continually run during active development and deployment.
log level not recorded; output in log is also a bit ambiguous (needs better annotation)
code does not run with specified input; get FileNotFoundError even when file confirmed to exist
any quantitative criteria on predicted output?  predicted output not recorded to log
No input option to generate new training data; this appears to be locked into just using the training data that you have provided.
